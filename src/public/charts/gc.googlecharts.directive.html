  <h4>What are Google Charts?</h4>
  <p>Google Charts is an interactive Web service that creates graphical charts from user-supplied information. The user supplies data and a formatting specification expressed in JavaScript embedded in a Web page; in response the service sends an image of the chart.</p>
  <p>The Google Charts service differs from the older service provided by the (now deprecated) Google Chart API (the names are similar and easily confused). Google Charts does not support the HTTP request method, and is thus not backward-compatible with user code for the Google Charts API. Upgrading legacy user code from Google Chart API to Google Charts thus requires a complete rewrite of the HTTP semantics in JavaScript.</p>
