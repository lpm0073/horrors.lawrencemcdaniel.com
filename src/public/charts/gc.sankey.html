  <h3>Sankey Diagram</h3>
  <p>A <code>sankey</code> diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things being connected are called nodes and the connections are called links. Sankeys are best used when you want to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors) or multiple paths through a set of stages (for instance, Google Analytics uses sankeys to show how traffic flows from pages to other pages on your web site).</p>
  <p>For the curious, they're named after Captain Sankey, who created a diagram of steam engine efficiency that used arrows having widths proportional to heat loss.</p>
  <p>Example: Suppose you had several countries -- USA, Mexico, Canada and Brasil -- that connect to several other countries -- Portugal, Spain, England, France. Some of those connections are heavier than others. For instance, Brasil has a thin connection to England and a much thicker connection to Portugal.</p>
