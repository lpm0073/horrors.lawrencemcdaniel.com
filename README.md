**It's coding time! Woohoo!!!**

## Time to Complete
It should take about an 1 hours or less. (This is just an estimate. People's backgrounds differ, so for some people it will take longer to complete.)

**Ask questions in [Week 5 Discussion Forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-page-web-apps-with-angularjs/discussions/weeks/5) if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someoneâ€™s help) can be a very valuable learning experience!**


## About this blog

### Organization


**D3 Animations**
When the user clicks on the `Sign Up` button, they should be taken to a view that lets them "sign up" for the newsletter (that will never come :-) ) of the restaurant. The sign up form should ask for the following information: first name, last name, email address, and phone number. It should also ask the user to specify the menu number that's their favorite dish. (The menu number is the `short_name` attribute of each menu item).

**Google Charts:**
When the user clicks on `My Info` button, they should be taken to another view where it shows them their "registered" information, including the favorite menu item they picked. When showing the favorite menu item, display the picture of the menu item as well as its title and description.

If the user hasn't yet "registered" through the `Sign Up` button, simply display a message saying: `Not Signed Up Yet. Sign up Now!`. The words "Sign up Now!" should be a link to the same view as the `Sign Up` link points to.


**Text Processing With AngularJS + HTML5:**

## Bonus (not graded)



### Rules
Do it the Angular way... We've covered this enough in the previous assignments and having the restaurant codebase the way it is, it would simply be more "painful" for you to try to do this without AngularJS, so I trust that you will pretty much be forced to do things the Angular way.

### Steps
I will not detail the steps in this assignment simply because pretty much all of them have been listed in the previous assignments. At this point, you have done the tasks I am asking you to do in this assignment in the previous assignments (with the exclusion of form validation, which you should just look up the lecture and sample code for.)


#### Important Implementation Notes
1. Make sure all of your Javascript code is inside of an IIFE. (*If you don't know what that is or why we'd want to use it, brush up on it by looking through module 4 of [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/) course I teach.*)
2. Make sure all of your dependency injections are protected from minification.
3. After you are done and satisfied with your solution, don't forget to add/commit/push your code to your repository.

## **IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**
* Closely follow the submission guidelines for this assignment on Coursera.org
* Make **sure** you provide the correct URL in your submission (it should be GitHub<b>.io</b>, *not* GitHub<b>.com</b>)
* Make **sure** to TEST your assignment not just on your local machine, but ALSO once you deploy it on GitHub, using the URL you are providing as part of your submission.
* This assignment will be peer-reviewed (and graded). The guidance will be given such that if submission instructions are not followed, the assignment is to be failed. This includes providing the wrong URL for your deployment. Following instructions is very much part of software development. After all, that's what software requirements are - instructions to follow.
